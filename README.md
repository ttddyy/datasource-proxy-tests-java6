# datasource-proxy-tests-java6

datasource-proxy java6 compatibility tests.

## Setup

According to [maven-wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper)

> The maven-wrapper itself is compiled to work with Java 5.
> The Takari Maven Plugin for installation however uses Java 7.
> Once the wrapper is installed with the plugin you should be able to use the wrapper on the project with Java 5 and up. This is however not really tested by the committers.

## Run tests

```sh
./mvnw test
```
